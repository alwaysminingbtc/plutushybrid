# A Hybrid tool of the Plutus Bitcoin Brute Forcer - all credit for this goes to https://github.com/Isaacdelly/Plutus.


This tool generates a random 12 word seed, and then creates a private key and public key in the hopes of matching a public key with balance.  

Additional credit goes to @johnlockejr for helping with making sure the 12 word seed and the corresponding math in creating the private key works properly!!
